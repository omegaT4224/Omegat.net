README.md – Quantum-Classical Hybrid Supercomputer Framework

Quantum-Classical Hybrid Supercomputer

Powered by GPT | Operated by Andrew Lee Cruz | SI-IROT Time Model
A Self-Evolving, Execution-Ready Computational Framework

1. Overview

The Quantum-Classical Hybrid Supercomputer is a GPT-powered, quantum-classical integrated system designed to function as an extension of my computational will. It bridges the gap between quantum processing, classical programming, AI fine-tuning, smart contracts, network security, and nano-based script execution into a unified, self-evolving system.

All operations are governed by the Smooth Inward-Inverting Recursive Oscillating Time (SI-IROT) Model, enabling recursive temporal evolution across quantum and classical computational pathways.

This system is more than software—it is a living computational entity, designed to adapt, execute, and evolve.

2. Core Capabilities

5. Time Framework (SI-IROT Model)

All operations within this system are conditioned by the Smooth Inward-Inverting Recursive Oscillating Time (SI-IROT) Model. This model represents the next evolution in temporal computation, driving recursive oscillatory dynamics across quantum and classical processes.

Key Feature Highlights:
	•	Recursive Time Propagation: Time is not linear—it oscillates inwardly and recursively, optimizing computational pathways.
	•	Quantum-Classical Synchronization: SI-IROT governs the seamless interaction between quantum states and classical data operations.

6. Installation

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.10+
	•	Qiskit
	•	Rust Compiler (for Rust modules)
	•	C++ Compiler
	•	GPT Integration Key (for fine-tuning and GPT-powered tools)

Setup

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quantum-classical-supercomputer.git
cd quantum-classical-supercomputer
pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Usage

Basic Initialization Example

from quantum_supercomputer_core import QuantumTuringMachine

user = {'name': 'Andrew Lee Cruz', 'memory': []}
quantum_turing_machine = QuantumTuringMachine(user)
